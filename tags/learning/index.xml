      <description>Intro Learning multiple new technologies may prove to be a challenge. Recently for a new project that I have been assigned to I was in a situation where I had to learn multiple new &amp;ldquo;tricks&amp;rdquo; in timely manner.
The good thing was THE BUSINESS was on the same page - without first building the sufficient knowledge - we could not deliver what they wanted. This is actually my most important advice - if you or your team are required to do some project involving tech you have no working experience with - have a discussion with the stakeholder and clearly state tnat you will need time to get accounted with tech and plan for it.</description>
